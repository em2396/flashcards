# Abstract
The goal of this project was to take semi finished code and make it completely functional. The goal is to create a game for the user, in the terminal, that asks a question, gives a list of possible answers, and when the user chooses, they will be told if their answer was incorrect or correct. And it will continue to the next card until it has gone through the deck, at which point, the game will be over.
